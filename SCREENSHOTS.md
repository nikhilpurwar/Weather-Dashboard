# Weather Dashboard - Screenshot Guide

## How to Add Real Screenshots

The README currently uses placeholder images. To add real screenshots of your application:

### 1. Take Screenshots

**Desktop View (800x500 recommended):**
- Open the application in your browser
- Draw a few polygons on the map
- Configure some color rules in the sidebar
- Take a full browser screenshot

**Mobile View (400x700 recommended):**
- Open browser developer tools
- Switch to mobile view (iPhone or Android)
- Open the sidebar menu
- Take a screenshot showing the mobile-responsive layout

**Feature Showcase (800x400 recommended):**
- Show polygon drawing in action
- Display color rules configuration
- Capture the legend and timeline slider

### 2. Upload Screenshots

**Option A: GitHub Repository**
1. Create a `screenshots/` folder in your repository
2. Upload your images there
3. Update README.md image URLs:
   ```markdown
   ![Desktop Dashboard](./screenshots/desktop-view.png)
   ![Mobile View](./screenshots/mobile-view.png)
   ![Polygon Features](./screenshots/polygon-features.png)
   ```

**Option B: External Service**
1. Upload to [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) or [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nikhilpurwar/Weather-Dashboard/issues)
2. Copy the direct image URLs
3. Replace the placeholder URLs in README.md

### 3. Update README.md

Replace these placeholder URLs with your actual image URLs:
- `https://via.placeholder.com/800x500/2563eb/ffffff?text=Desktop+Dashboard+View`
- `https://via.placeholder.com/400x700/10b981/ffffff?text=Mobile+Responsive+View`
- `https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/f59e0b/ffffff?text=Polygon+Drawing+%26+Color+Rules`

### 4. Commit Changes

```bash
git add README.md screenshots/
git commit -m "Add real application screenshots"
git push
```

## Screenshot Tips

- **Use consistent browser**: Chrome or Firefox for best results
- **Clean data**: Use meaningful polygon labels and realistic data
- **Good lighting**: Ensure screenshots are clear and well-lit
- **Multiple examples**: Show different features and use cases
- **Annotations**: Consider adding arrows or labels to highlight features

## Image Optimization

Before uploading, optimize your images:
- **Format**: Use PNG for screenshots with text, JPG for photos
- **Size**: Compress images to reduce loading time
- **Dimensions**: Follow the recommended sizes above
- **Quality**: Ensure images are sharp and readable

Your README will look much more professional with real screenshots!
